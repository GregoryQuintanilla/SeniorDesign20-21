/**  
 * This way I think it will be easier to organize the logic of our functions and process. index.js will be used more as the routing and interface
 * between these functions and the https calls to the server. 
 * 
 * This will begin to feel like what our "API" will look like. There are a few different forms the export can be created. I like this method 
 * better. I think it's easier this way for structure. There are some other ways I have seen that package and send ALL function written, but this
 * way we only give the NodeJS route access to the ones we want it to have.
 * 
 * The below also accomplish the goal and in the end it's semantic and oraganization. All of them complete the same goals.
